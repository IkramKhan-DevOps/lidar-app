# âœ… Missing Plugin Implementation - FIXED!

## Issues Resolved

### 1. **Missing Swift Classes**
Created the required Swift classes that were referenced in `AppDelegate.swift`:

- **`ScanMetadata.swift`** - Data structure for scan metadata
- **`ScanLocalStorage.swift`** - Local storage management for scans

### 2. **Method Channel Setup**
Verified and confirmed:
- âœ… Method channel properly initialized in `AppDelegate.swift` 
- âœ… Channel name matches between iOS and Flutter: `"com.demo.channel/message"`
- âœ… All required methods are handled in the switch statement
- âœ… `getSavedScans` method is properly implemented

### 3. **Project Build**
- âœ… iOS project builds successfully
- âœ… All dependencies resolved
- âœ… No compilation errors

## What Was Missing

The `MissingPluginException` error occurred because:

1. **Missing Swift Classes**: `ScanMetadata` and `ScanLocalStorage` classes were referenced but not defined as separate files
2. **Incomplete Setup**: The Swift classes needed for local storage and metadata management were missing

## Files Created

1. **`ios/Runner/ScanMetadata.swift`**
   - Codable struct for scan metadata
   - Handles JSON serialization/deserialization
   - Stores scan properties like name, timestamp, status, etc.

2. **`ios/Runner/ScanLocalStorage.swift`**  
   - Singleton class for local scan management
   - File system operations for scans
   - Metadata loading/saving functionality
   - Image management utilities

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fix works:

### 1. Run the Flutter app
```bash
flutter run ios
```

### 2. Check for method channel connectivity
The `getSavedScans` method should now work without throwing `MissingPluginException`.

### 3. Look for log messages
Check Xcode console for debug logs:
- `ðŸ“± [GET SAVED SCANS] Method called, online: YES/NO`
- `ðŸ“± [GET SAVED SCANS] Getting local scans...`
- `ðŸ“± [GET SAVED SCANS] Returning X total scans (API + Local)`

## Next Steps

1. **Test the app** - Run it on a device/simulator
2. **Check scan functionality** - Try creating and viewing scans
3. **Monitor logs** - Check for any remaining issues
4. **Authentication** - Set up auth token if API calls fail with 401

## Debug Commands

If you still see issues:

```bash
# Clean and rebuild
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build ios --debug

# Check for compilation errors
cd ios && xcodebuild -workspace Runner.xcworkspace -scheme Runner build
```

## Authentication Setup

If API calls fail with 401 errors, you need to set up authentication:

1. **Login in your Flutter app** to get an auth token
2. **Token should be stored** in UserDefaults/SharedPreferences  
3. **Check token storage**:
   ```swift
   print("Auth token: \(UserDefaults.standard.string(forKey: "auth_token") ?? "NOT FOUND")")
   ```

Your method channel should now be working properly! ðŸŽ‰
